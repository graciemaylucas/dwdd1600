<h1>Discrimination Against Women in Gaming</h1>

<h2>So... What is it like?</h2>
<p><strong> About Skill:</strong> There is often a stereotype that women are less skilled or less interested in gaming, which can lead to women being underestimated, dismissed, or excluded from gaming communities and tournaments.</p>
<p><strong>Representation in Games:</strong> Women are often underrepresented or misrepresented in video games, with female characters frequently portrayed in stereotypical or hypersexualized ways. This can contribute to a culture that marginalizes female gamers and developers.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusion from Communities:</strong> Women often face gatekeeping, where they are questioned about their knowledge of games or excluded from gaming groups. This can make it hard for women to feel like they belong in gaming spaces and can deter them from pursuing their passion for gaming.</p>
<p><strong>Despite these challenges,</strong> many women are actively pushing back against discrimination, building supportive communities, and advocating for change in the gaming world. As more attention is drawn to these issues, <a href="help.html#How">the industry is slowly moving towards greater inclusion and respect for women in gaming.</a></p>

<h2>Women in Esports and Competitive Gaming</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Women in professional gaming face similar challenges, including exclusion from teams, unequal pay, and a lack of representation in major tournaments. The esports scene has historically been male-dominated, with few opportunities for women to compete at the same level.</li>
    <li>Women are significantly underrepresented in professional esports leagues and tournaments. Most top-level esports teams and competitions, such as those in games like <em>League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO), and Dota 2</em>, are dominated by men. Female teams or players rarely reach the same level of visibility or financial backing as their male counterparts.</li>
